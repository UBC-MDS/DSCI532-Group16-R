# Mental Health Awareness Dashboard
Deployment on Heroku: https://it-mental-health-dash-r.herokuapp.com/

![app demo](images/app_showcase_demo.gif)

The app is a dashboard to more efficiently consume the [mental illness survey data](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey) and drive insights into different areas of mental illness awareness in tech companies around the world. After landing on this dashboard, users can filter generic company, employee and mental health related filters on the left hand side. For example, they can filter by region and age group. The filtering will then drive the visualizations on the tabbed right side of the app.

Each tab will then answer specific topics that our target audience might be interested in. For example, the tabs could include:
- Awareness (of mental illness)
- Healthcare Benefits (vs mental illness)
- Privacy (around mental illness)

Within each tab, we may include different visualizations that will tell a story around each topic. For example, the user may try to understand mental illness awareness by state by going to the Awareness tab and then toggling different states in the US.
